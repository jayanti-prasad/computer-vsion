# Computer Vision

Computer Vision (CV) is one of the important components of Artificial Intelligence. The primary data for computer vision is images (including videos). The main objective of computer vision is to extract information from images, and there are two main approaches for that:

- Feature-based
- Deep Learning

In the first approach, we try to find a set of features in any image, and there are available algorithms for that. Some of these algorithms are based on gradients. In order to develop/implement an algorithm, one needs to have a good knowledge of linear algebra and calculus.

##  What do we have here?
In this repository, I plan to host a set of Jupyter notebooks to process image data. The names of the notebooks will be suggested. I also plan to provide references. The data used for examples will also be provided.

## Required software:

NumPy
Matplotlib
OpenCV
Scikit-learn
